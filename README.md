# hackathon-recruit
It is a platform which is similar to LinkedIn, wherein women developers can display the multiple projects they have worked on and skills they have acquired, also allowing recruiters to search through and filter out candidates based on the skills required for a specific role. Here we have added the additional functionality of adding reviews and interview experiences which will allow the candidates to write a review or experience of any company, similar to websites like Glassdoor.
